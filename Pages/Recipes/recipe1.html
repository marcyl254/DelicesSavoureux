       <b> MAKES 9</b> <br>

1 portion rough puff pastry or 1 pack shop-bought puff pastry
4½ tsp demerara sugar. <br> <br>

FOR THE COMPOTE
<br><br>
250g strawberries, hulled<br>
25g caster sugar 1 tbsp lemon juice 50g raspberries<br> <br>

FOR THE CREME PATISSIERE
<br><br>
500ml whole milk<br>
½ vanilla pod, split, seeds scraped, pod reserved 100g caster sugar 4 egg yolks 40g cornflour 40g unsalted butter
<br><br>
FOR THE CHOUX PASTRY
<br><br>
55g unsalted butter, diced<br>
pinch salt 70g plain flour 2 eggs, beaten beaten egg, for brushing nibbed sugar, for sprinkling
<br><br>
1. For the compote, tip the strawberries into a pan with the sugar and lemon juice. Cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes. Add the raspberries and cook for a further 5-10 minutes, until reduced to a thick compote (but not a jam). Remove from the heat, cool, then chill.
<br><br>
2. For the crème pâtissière, put the milk in a pan with the vanilla pod and seeds. Bring to the boil, then remove from the heat. Whisk the sugar, yolks and cornflour together in a large bowl. Whisk a little hot milk into the sugar and egg mixture, then whisk in the rest of the hot milk until well combined. Return to the pan. Cook over a gentle heat, stirring until it thickens.
<br><br>
3. Remove from the heat and pass through a sieve into a clean bowl. Add the butter and stir until melted. Leave to cool, cover with clingfilm and chill until cold.
<br><br>
4. Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Lightly dust the worktop, roll out the puff pastry to a 35cm square. Using a 10cm cutter, cut out 9 discs. Place on baking sheets and prick each disc all over with a fork. Chill for 30 minutes.
<br><br>
5. For the choux pastry, place the butter, salt and 150ml of water in a medium pan. Heat gently to melt the butter, then bring to the boil. Immediately remove from the heat and tip in the flour. Beat with a wooden spoon to form a smooth ball of dough that leaves the sides of the pan.
<br><br>
6. Vigorously beat the 2 eggs into the hot dough, a little at a time, until the dough is stiff and glossy. You may not need all the egg – stop if the dough becomes loose. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm plain nozzle.
<br><br>
7. Pipe the choux in a circle 5mm in from the edge of each disc. Brush each choux ring with beaten egg and sprinkle with nibbed sugar. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until puffed, crisp and golden. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
<br><br>
8. To assemble, spoon the crème pâtissière into a piping bag fitted with a 1.5cm plain nozzle. Spoon the strawberry compote into the pastry shells and pipe the crème pâtissière over the top. Sprinkle ½ teaspoon of demerara sugar on top of each and, using a blowtorch, brûle the sugar. Serve the Puits D’Amour immediately.
