<b>Directions</b>
<br><br>
To make roasted duck a l’orange: Preheat your oven to 325°F (160ºC). In the meantime, season the duck with salt and pepper and brown the whole duck in a large cast-iron skillet on all sides, about 10 minutes.<br><br>
<br><br>
2. Arrange garlic heads, onion, carrots, herbs in the bottom of a baking pan and arrange browned duck on top, this helps the duck meat crisp better. Roast duck in the oven for 90 minutes, turning it upside down every 30 minutes to roast the neat evenly.
<br><br>
3. Meanwhile, boil the vinegar, orange juice, and honey in a small saucepan. Pour in the chicken stock little by little, stirring constantly. Set aside.
<br><br>
4. Blanch the orange slices in boiling water for 2 minutes, then transfer to a salad bowl. Pour Grand Marnier over the orange slices, and marinate while the duck is roasting.
<br><br>
5. When the duck is done after 90 minutes, remove it from the oven and cover it with foil. Increase the oven temperature to 450ºF (230ºC) and arrange the marinated orange slices around the duck, sprinkle with orange zest. Return the duck to the oven and roast for 10 – 15 minutes, until the skin is crisped up.
<br><br>
6. To finish the orange sauce: Bring it to a simmer in the saucepan, add in cornstarch, then swirl in the butter one tablespoon at a time until thickened. Adjust seasoning to your liking.
<br><br>
7. To serve, carve the duck, slice de duck breasts, and arrange on a serving platter with roasted veggies and garnished with fresh thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves. Transfer the orange sauce to a serving vessel. Serve the roasted duck a l’orange immediately. Enjoy
